Here you can find some of the analytical dashboards built by me, as well the source code.
### Bayesian A/B test calculator
Universal calculator for any kind of A/B tests, build 100% with R and Shiny.

### Finances
This is an app for managing personal finances built with R Shiny, and hosted on this server.
This is a copy of the app I was using myself for controlling my expenses.
It uses Postgre as a database, but only for that several people can load it to watch and test, but for the personal use this is an overkill.
Duckdb should just fine ;)_

### Mail server dashboard
This dashboard was build to control the burden on an email server doing marketing campaign, and prevent it from overloading.
The capacity was around 500 emails per hour, and campaigns were sent all day long.
So it was necessary to constantly get the data from the mail server.
It's built in Python Plotly Dash, and was deployed on a private server, this is a sample app, using sample data, deployed on heroku.
It also has better funnier colorscheme (:
