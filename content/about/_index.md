# About myself
I am a data analyst with background in sales and business development, which makes me good at understanding business requirements.

 I'm actively developing in fields of applied statistics, probability, and machine learning, though I'm capable also of building data pipelines, databases, and data engineering. 
 
I'm passionate about data analytics, always taking my time to learn new, and become a better expert, because analytics for is not only means to earn, but also a way to perceive a world around me.

If you would like to work together, you could benefit from hiring a person who is passionate about all that's data, and with a nice set of soft skills, including teamwork, time-management, leadership, and communication.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
